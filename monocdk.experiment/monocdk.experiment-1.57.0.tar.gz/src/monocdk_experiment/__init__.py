# monocdk Experiment

[![experimental](http://badges.github.io/stability-badges/dist/experimental.svg)](http://github.com/badges/stability-badges)

An **experiment** to bundle all of the CDK into a single module.

> :warning: Please don't use this module unless you are interested in providing
> feedback about this experience.

## Usage

### Installation

To try out `monocdk-experiment` replace all references to CDK Construct
Libraries (most `@aws-cdk/*` packages) in your `package.json` file with a single
entrey referring to `monocdk-experiment`.

You also need to add a reference to the `constructs` library, according to the
kind of project you are developing:

* For libraries, model the dependency under `devDependencies` **and** `peerDependencies`
* For apps, model the dependency under `dependencies` only

### Use in your code

#### Classic import

You can use a classic import to get access to each service namespaces:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
from monocdk_experiment import core, aws_s3 as s3

app = core.App()
stack = core.Stack(app, "MonoCDK-Stack")

s3.Bucket(stack, "TestBucket")
```

#### Barrel import

Alternatively, you can use "barrel" imports:

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
from monocdk_experiment import App, Stack
from monocdk_experiment.aws_s3 import Bucket

app = App()
stack = Stack(app, "MonoCDK-Stack")

Bucket(stack, "TestBucket")
```

        :param max_batch_size: Specifies the maximum number of instances that AWS CloudFormation updates.
        :param min_instances_in_service: Specifies the minimum number of instances that must be in service within the Auto Scaling group while AWS CloudFormation updates old instances.
        :param min_successful_instances_percent: Specifies the percentage of instances in an Auto Scaling rolling update that must signal success for an update to succeed. You can specify a value from 0 to 100. AWS CloudFormation rounds to the nearest tenth of a percent. For example, if you update five instances with a minimum successful percentage of 50, three instances must signal success. If an instance doesn't send a signal within the time specified in the PauseTime property, AWS CloudFormation assumes that the instance wasn't updated. If you specify this property, you must also enable the WaitOnResourceSignals and PauseTime properties.
        :param pause_time: The amount of time that AWS CloudFormation pauses after making a change to a batch of instances to give those instances time to start software applications. For example, you might need to specify PauseTime when scaling up the number of instances in an Auto Scaling group. If you enable the WaitOnResourceSignals property, PauseTime is the amount of time that AWS CloudFormation should wait for the Auto Scaling group to receive the required number of valid signals from added or replaced instances. If the PauseTime is exceeded before the Auto Scaling group receives the required number of signals, the update fails. For best results, specify a time period that gives your applications sufficient time to get started. If the update needs to be rolled back, a short PauseTime can cause the rollback to fail. Specify PauseTime in the ISO8601 duration format (in the format PT#H#M#S, where each # is the number of hours, minutes, and seconds, respectively). The maximum PauseTime is one hour (PT1H).
        :param suspend_processes: Specifies the Auto Scaling processes to suspend during a stack update. Suspending processes prevents Auto Scaling from interfering with a stack update. For example, you can suspend alarming so that Auto Scaling doesn't execute scaling policies associated with an alarm. For valid values, see the ScalingProcesses.member.N parameter for the SuspendProcesses action in the Auto Scaling API Reference.
        :param wait_on_resource_signals: Specifies whether the Auto Scaling group waits on signals from new instances during an update. Use this property to ensure that instances have completed installing and configuring applications before the Auto Scaling group update proceeds. AWS CloudFormation suspends the update of an Auto Scaling group after new EC2 instances are launched into the group. AWS CloudFormation must receive a signal from each new instance within the specified PauseTime before continuing the update. To signal the Auto Scaling group, use the cfn-signal helper script or SignalResource API. To have instances wait for an Elastic Load Balancing health check before they signal success, add a health-check verification by using the cfn-init helper script. For an example, see the verify_instance_health command in the Auto Scaling rolling updates sample template.

        By default, uses
        the ``HashedAddressingScheme`` but this method can be overridden to customize
        this behavior.

        In order to make sure logical IDs are unique and stable, we hash the resource
        construct tree path (i.e. toplevel/secondlevel/.../myresource) and add it as
        a suffix to the path components joined without a separator (CloudFormation
        IDs only allow alphanumeric characters).

        The result will be:

        <path.join('')><md5(path.join('/')>
        "human"      "hash"

        If the "human" part of the ID exceeds 240 characters, we simply trim it so
        the total ID doesn't exceed CloudFormation's 255 character limit.

        We only take 8 characters from the md5 hash (0.000005 chance of collision).

        Special cases:

        - If the path only contains a single component (i.e. it's a top-level
          resource), we won't add the hash to it. The hash is not needed for
          disamiguation and also, it allows for a more straightforward migration an
          existing CloudFormation template to a CDK stack without logical ID changes
          (or renames).
        - For aesthetic reasons, if the last components of the path are the same
          (i.e. ``L1/L2/Pipeline/Pipeline``), they will be de-duplicated to make the
          resulting human portion of the ID more pleasing: ``L1L2Pipeline<HASH>``
          instead of ``L1L2PipelinePipeline<HASH>``
        - If a component is named "Default" it will be omitted from the path. This
          allows refactoring higher level abstractions around constructs without affecting
          the IDs of already deployed resources.
        - If a component is named "Resource" it will be omitted from the user-visible
          path, but included in the hash. This reduces visual noise in the human readable
          part of the identifier.
